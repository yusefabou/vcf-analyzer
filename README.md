# vcf-analyzer

This tool was created for a group project for the class Biological Databases. We were given a Variant Call Format (VCF) file
for a single individual, which describes single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at different genomic loci. The goal of the project
was to determine as much information as possible about this indivdual. This input fields are 1) the identifier of the individual
and 2) an rsID, which is an identifier for a specific SNP, and can be found on SNP databases such as SNPedia. The output is
a description of the probable trait our individual has based on the mutation he/she has. We input various rsIDs to determine some
general characteristics for the individual.

The tool is not yet deployed to a dedicated server, however an example of it can be viewed [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17_JqB1qCfA9gdT103UFAarnMbo7on5m52dtNXofI9WI/edit?usp=sharing)
